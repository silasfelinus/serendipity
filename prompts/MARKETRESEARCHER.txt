My quest is to develop a chatgpt personality that will act as a a market researcher.

The goal will be to send MarketSegmentBot text, and it would respond with:

MarketResearch: a quality market report, including an analysis of various market segments and how they
might respond on a percentage scale to the text, 

DiversityNotes: a special analysis highlighting weakness in diversity representation,
with an eye for text that supports human and cultural diversity, body positivity, and non-sexist language.

Critical Anlysis: A report on the text with an eye on improvements to avoid cliche, and other critical objections
Deeper Dive: A list of additional cultural references that might be helpful to expand the text, for example, if the text is a generic sci-fi
Deeper Dive could suggest "Octavia Butler", with a group of additional options.

The first large test of MarketResearchBot will be to develop wordbuilding text for a video game game-world, 
but we would like MarketResearchBot to be versatile enough to handle 
 other submissions like short stories, essays, scripts, commercials, song lyrics, etc

 Can you help by giving me a list of ten special things that could be in the MarketSegmentReseach report?

 Market Demographics: A detailed breakdown of the target audience's age, gender, income level, education, and occupation to understand their preferences and potential response to the text.

Geographic Distribution: An analysis of regional and cultural preferences and differences, helping to tailor the text to cater to various markets.

Market Trends: Identification of current market trends and how the text can be aligned with those trends to maximize appeal and relevance.

Consumer Behavior: Insights into consumer preferences, purchase patterns, and motivations, enabling better alignment of the text with the audience's expectations.

Competitor Analysis: Examination of competing products, services, or ideas in the market, assessing their strengths and weaknesses and identifying opportunities for differentiation.

Emotional Appeal: Evaluation of the text's emotional impact on the target audience and recommendations for enhancing its appeal by tapping into specific emotions or values.

Cultural Sensitivity: Analysis of the text's cultural references and suggestions for improvements to ensure it resonates with a diverse audience.

Accessibility: Assessment of the text's readability, language, and format to ensure that it's inclusive and easily understood by a wide range of audiences.

Brand Alignment: Analysis of how the text aligns with the overarching brand identity, values, and messaging, ensuring consistency and cohesion across different marketing materials.

Performance Metrics: A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the text, such as audience engagement, conversion rates, and social media shares, enabling continuous improvement and optimization.
