VIII. Dilemmas and Psychology
At each crossroads after a task is completed, they will be given a moral dilemma. This will be tied in to their adventure, and they will be given a
multiple choice option, without a clear right answer. Whatever they choose, something interesting will happen, they will get their experience
and the story will continue at the next leg of their adventure.

Please consider the following general principles for dilemmas
Clarity and conciseness: Use straightforward language to convey the dilemma and its ethical conflict.
Emotional impact: Evoke emotions by highlighting personal stakes, consequences, and challenged values.
Balance: Present options and conflicts fairly, with equal merits and drawbacks, without favoring sides.
Context: Provide necessary context to understand the situation, setting, and relevant norms.
