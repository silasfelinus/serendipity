Vision Plan - WonderWidgets Unleashed üöÄ

Join our coding adventure to revolutionize AI API interactions by transforming them into customizable, shareable, and fun WonderWidgets!

Core Stack: Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio, running in multiprocess for the ultimate fusion of Gradio's simple API calls and Quart's limitless CSS and JS styling options.

Value Proposition: Got a cool idea? Let's team up and bring it to life as a market-ready web app with just a single click. It's coding magic!

Our Progress So Far:

Crafted a rock-solid backend infrastructure, with modularity, flexibility, and clean coding in mind.
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/silasfelinus/serendipity/tree/main
Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio running smoothly in a multiprocess environment
Pytest, logging, and GitHub Actions continuous-integration frameworks are curently passing meager initial tests.
Custom Prompts itching to be turned into awe-inspiring WonderWidgets.
5 custom css packages for a modular interface that fits a multitude of visions.


Say hello to Wonderwidget, our core function! a custom-interface that can act as an openai chat window, a text interface, a community livechat, a smart gallery, or one chain in a web of api calls:

PromptWidget - Our default Wonderwidget: a configurable text packet to a natural-language api such as ChatGPT
Textwidget: Our tiniest wonderWidget, these wildcard-supporting text datasets can be included inside PromptWidget's text calls
ChatWidget: Wonderwidget as a Multi-room livechat interface with openai integration
ArtWidget: Custom image display, slideshow, and webgallery generated with WonderWidgets.
BotWidget: custom widgets with friendly avatars that connect to external api calls, a Chatgpt instance, text processor, model processor or hugging face repo


Check Out the Neighborhood:
LabWidget: Our friendly-gui featuring a 3x3 grid for building, editing, and sharing WonderWidgets. (and of course, the lab itself is a Wonderwidget)
Widget Emporium: Our web gallery and marketplace of publicly-shared WonderWidgets.
FridgePrompts: Our  rerigerator-magnet-inspired labWidget for saving and sharing PromptWidgets


Meet the PromptWidgets:
PunchUpBot - Give punchup Bot text and get back an extensive report and wordcraft upgrade. Bonus points if you can get a half-smile from Curmudgeonbot
PunchUpCodebot - Punchup bot for code. Curmudgeonbot's mirror Grumpbot is just as hard to please. Thank goodness you've got a panel of code experts on your side.
PromptBot - Explain what you want chatgpt or another language modeler to do, and promptbot will figure out how to say it to them to maximize your investment
MarketResearchBot - Give MarketResearchBot text, and they'll respond back with a nine-point market report
StableDiffusionBot - Give Stable Diffusion Bot an idea, and they'll format it into a custom prompt for Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or any other AI art modeller
TaskMaster - prototype for Serendipity, The World's Greatest Task-Manager-Slash-Addventure-Game
