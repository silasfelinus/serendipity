Vision Plan - WonderWidgets Unleashed üöÄ

Join our coding adventure to revolutionize AI API interactions by transforming them into customizable, shareable, and fun WonderWidgets!

Core Stack: Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio, running in multiprocess for the ultimate fusion of Gradio's simple API calls and Quart's limitless CSS and JS styling options.

Value Proposition: Got a cool idea? Let's team up and bring it to life as a market-ready web app with just a single click. It's coding magic!

The Dream:
A playful single-page Wonderwidget lab showcasing programmable, themeable WonderWidgets.
An API webservice playground featuring dynamic JavaScript and drag-and-drop functionality
Entertaining idle animations and text scrolls to keep people entertained while waiting for the next process.
Jazz up the experience with personalized, themed avatars.
Let's get social: user logins, live chat, and customizable ChatWidgets for one-of-a-kind conversations.
The Ultimate Vision: An all-in-one portal that turns complex API interactions into child's play through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. 
Let's inspire fellow coders to explore, create, and share their WonderWidgets with the world!

Our Progress So Far:

Consciously-crafted infrastructure built with modularity, flexibility, and clean coding in mind.
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/silasfelinus/serendipity/tree/main
Python 3.8, Quart, and Gradio running smoothly in a multiprocess environment
Pytest, logging, and GitHub Actions continuous-integration frameworks are curently passing initial tests.
Library of Custom Prompts itching to be turned into awe-inspiring WonderWidgets.
5 custom css packages for a modular interface that fits a multitude of visions.
Various art assets that need to be stitched in by the world's most awkward html designer.


Say hello to Wonderwidget, our core function! A custom-interface that can act as an ChatGPT chat window, text interface, community livechat, smart gallery, or one chain in a web of api calls.

PromptWidget - a configurable text packet intended for a natural-language api such as ChatGPT
ChatWidget: a Multi-room livechat interface with openai integration
ArtWidget: image display
BotWidget: friendly avatars representing connections to language processor apis such as Chatgpt
LibrarianWidget: CRUD database access to Mongo

With help from: 
TaskWidget, our helpful task-manager!

Check Out the Neighborhood:
LabWidget: Our friendly-gui featuring a 3x3 grid for building, editing, and sharing WonderWidgets. (and of course, the lab itself is a Wonderwidget)
Widgetbar: collapsible header with artwidget icons
sidebar: collapsible sidebar with navigation lines (and artwidget icons)
trashwidget: draganddrop icon to trash widgets
widgetshed: drag and drop icon to save/load widgets





Meet the PromptWidgets:
PunchUpBot - Give punchup Bot text and get back an extensive report and wordcraft upgrade. Bonus points if you can get a half-smile from Curmudgeonbot
PunchUpCodebot - Punchup bot for code. Curmudgeonbot's mirror Grumpbot is just as hard to please. Thank goodness you've got a panel of code experts on your side.
PromptBot - Explain what you want chatgpt or another language modeler to do, and promptbot will figure out how to say it to them to maximize your investment
MarketResearchBot - Give MarketResearchBot text, and they'll respond back with a nine-point market report
StableDiffusionBot - Give Stable Diffusion Bot an idea, and they'll format it into a custom prompt for Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or any other AI art modeller
TaskMaster - prototype for Serendipity, The World's Greatest Task-Manager-Slash-Addventure-Game
Weirdlandia - A storytelling bot modelled after r20 systems but set in a..much weirder setting
Got a PromptWidget? Tell it to the librarianbot (coming soon)

Pitch: Hey, fellow coders! We're building something amazing over at GitHub and WonderWidgets, and we want YOU to join us. Are you ready for a coding adventure of a lifetime? Let's unleash the power of WonderWidgets together! üéâüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
