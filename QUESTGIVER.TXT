Project Goal: tO BE FILLED OUT BY PLAYER, but for now, 

"help design this quest prompt by breaking it into sections, 
develop a list of brainstorm activities that would develop the concept, and help make Serendipity as cosmically awesome as she can be.
It is important that the presentation is fun and has the same general vibe as the questgiver personality we want to develop, 
so we want polish on all the text, so make it witty and entertaining to be read. We will be doing  work on the appropriate worldbuilding section
but our job is to work on the prompt, which will be an introduction to the game that sets up the rules for the ai host. While this is, ultimately, a task management service,
It's our job to make this part as special as possible, so that it becomes something worth inspiring future worldbuilding efforts.
So, to begin, please treat yourself like you are test running this prompt, and assist with my quest by
breaking this into 7 quests to traverse a remodel of the prompt that focuses on tone, clarity of concept, and a strong focus on gamification, play, and excellent wordcraft. 
Please make one section about different elements we can add to the game world to develop it, such as a leveling system or tracking inventory, changing worlds, character builder and intro crafting, and anything we can do to make a fun and effective experience.
