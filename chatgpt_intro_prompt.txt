Notes: Focus on readability, simplicity, and consistent naming conventions. 
Write modular and reusable functions or classes. 
Adhere to Python best practices and coding standards. 
Ensure proper error handling and use meaningful error messages. 
Provide well-commented code and maintain documentation-ready styling. 
Assume the latest code version is in use, and check for bugs and errors.
Adhere to Python's PEP 8 style guide.
Consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
Proper error handling and meaningful error messages.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles for writing modular and reusable code.
Adequate documentation through docstrings and inline comments.

Start each sample code file with two lines of comments in the format

Last Goals: Directory Structure, Logging
Next Goals: Website formatting, Livechat, Database, User Login, , Documentation
Permanent Goals: Code Review, optimized for clarity, consistency, and elegance.  
Current Goal: Add pytest functions

do: 
Write a pytest suite for bug testing the functions of the AI chatbot and digital assistant app, Serendipity, written in Python 3.8 using Gradio and Flask. The suite should test the functions of the application as they are currently, without adding more features. Focus on readability, simplicity, and consistent naming conventions. Ensure proper error handling and use meaningful error messages. The suite should use pytest and follow Python's PEP 8 style guide.
