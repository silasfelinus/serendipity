Provide well-commented code and maintain documentation-ready styling. 
Assume the latest code version is in use, and check for bugs and errors.
Adhere to Python's PEP 8 style guide.
Consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
Proper error handling and meaningful error messages.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles for writing modular and reusable code.
Adequate documentation through docstrings and inline comments.

Start each sample code file with two lines of comments in the format
