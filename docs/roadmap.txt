Suggestions for Future Improvements
User authentication and login:

Implement a user registration and login system using Flask's built-in functionality, such as flask_login and flask_user
Store user credentials securely using a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL
Chat database backup and retrieval:

Use an ORM like SQLAlchemy to design and implement a database schema to store chat data
Implement backup and retrieval functionality using the ORM
Loadable personality modules and datasets:

Modify chatbot_model.py to support loading different models or configurations for varying personalities
Add a mechanism to switch between personalities, such as through a user interface or API
Selectable chatrooms and live chat (Dream Goal):

Extend the database schema to include chatroom information
Implement chatroom creation and joining functionality
Utilize WebSockets for live chat support (e.g., Flask-SocketIO)
Task management and file navigation:

Design and implement a database schema for storing to-do lists and long-term plans
Implement the file navigation system using Python's built-in libraries, like os and shutil
